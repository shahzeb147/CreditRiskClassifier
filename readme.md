# Credit Risk Classification with Neural Networks

## Overview

Developed a neural network model to predict loan repayment status (Paid, Current, Risky) using LendingClubâ€™s dataset of ~2.3M loans. Engineered a robust preprocessing pipeline and achieved 96.69% accuracy and 94.87% macro F1-score, with a strong 0.8928 F1-score for the Risky class.

## Dataset

Source: LendingClub loan data (~2.3M samples).

Features: 59 after preprocessing (e.g., loan amount, FICO scores, debt-to-income ratio).

Classes: Paid (~47.7%), Current (~38.8%), Risky (~13.4%, combining Charged Off/Default and Delinquent).
## Challenges and Insights

Data Preprocessing: Handled NaN values and unmapped statuses with robust checks, ensuring data integrity for ~2.3M loans.

Pipeline Complexity: Engineered a custom preprocessing pipeline to manage 59 features, streamlining data preparation.


Insight: Combining domain knowledge, rigorous preprocessing, and weighted loss was critical for high performance on imbalanced data.

## Future Work

Explore ensemble models (e.g., combining neural networks with Random Forest).

Incorporate temporal features (e.g., loan age) for dynamic risk prediction.
## Key Results
